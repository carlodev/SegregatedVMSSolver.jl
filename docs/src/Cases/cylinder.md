# Cylinder

The Cylinder case can be used to see how meshes created in  [`gmsh`](https://gmsh.info/) are manged and to obtain the vortex shedding phenomena.
The user has to create a proper mesh in [`gmsh`](https://gmsh.info/) setting the following physical boundaries:
- `inlet` for the inlet
- `outlet` for the outlet
- `cylinder` for the cylinder walls
- `limits` for the top and bottom boundaries

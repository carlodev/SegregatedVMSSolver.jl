# Airfoil

![LSB-s7003](../assets/LSB-sd7003.png)

It is one of the most complex and intersting case. The user has to create a proper mesh in [`gmsh`](https://gmsh.info/) setting the following physical boundaries:
- `inlet` for the inlet
- `outlet` for the outlet
- `airfoil` for the airfoil walls
- `limits` for the top and bottom boundaries

!!! info ".geo file" 
    In the folder `models/geofile/` is possible to find some `.geo` file created using [`gmsh`](https://gmsh.info/) both for 3D and 2D simulations. Different parameters can be modified: angle of attack, domain dimension, mesh divisions... feel free to explore it.

The velocity at the inlet is incresed from `0.0` arriving to the target value `u_in` at `:t_endramp`. This increase the numeric stability. If `:t_endramp` = `:t0` the velocity at the inlet will be immediately `:u_in`. For numeric stability is better to keep `u_in = 1.0`, then fix the Reynolds and so the viscosity will be automatically computed as: `Î½ = 1/Reynolds`

The pressure is set `0.0` at the `outlet` section. The velocity on the `limits` is set equal to the one at `inlet`.

## Suggested workflow
3D LES are heavy and it is possible to experience divergence issues. It is suggested to use one of the two initilization tecniques: `Velocity ramping` or `Boundary layer initialization`

### Velocity ramping
By setting `t_endramp > t0` automatically the code will create an inlet velocity which will increase linearly in time up to the `u_in` target value.

```julia
using PartitionedArrays
using MPI
using SegregatedVMSSolver
using SegregatedVMSSolver.ParametersDef
using SegregatedVMSSolver.SolverOptions
```
Calling the dependencies


```julia
t0 =0.0
dt = 1e-3
tF = 5e-3

Re = 10
D = 2
rank_partition = (2,2)
airfoil_mesh_file = joinpath(@__DIR__,"..", "..", "models", "DU89_2D_A1_M.msh")
```

```julia
timep = TimeParameters(t0,dt,tF)

physicalp = PhysicalParameters(Re=Re)
solverp = SolverParameters(M=2)
exportp = ExportParameters(printinitial=false,printmodel=false,name_tags=["airfoil"], fieldexport=[["uh"]])

meshp= MeshParameters(rank_partition,D,airfoil_mesh_file)
simparams = SimulationParameters(timep,physicalp,solverp,exportp)
```
Setting the parameters. This simulation will not converge, we are not using a suitable solver which needs hypre.


Defining the stabilizatin problem and the simualtion case
```julia
sprob = StabilizedProblem(VMS(1))
simcase = Airfoil(meshp,simparams,sprob)
```

Solve in Sequential - on 1 processor not using MPI, useful for debug.
```julia
 SegregatedVMSSolver.main(simcase,with_debug)
```

Solve in MPI - for HPC computing
```julia
 SegregatedVMSSolver.main(simcase,with_mpi)
```

Then in bash give the command. Check the MPI section for more details
```bash
 mpiexecjl -n 4 julia --project=. run_mysimulation.jl
```







### Boundary Layer initialization
